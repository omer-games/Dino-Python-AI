# Dino Game Python AI

Dino Game Python AI is a Python program that utilizes a neural network and machine learning to teach a dinosaur to play the classic T-Rex Run game autonomously.

## Credit for Original Game

This program is built upon a Python T-Rex Run game created by dhhruv.
https://github.com/dhhruv/Chrome-Dino-Runner

## How it Works

The program employs a neural network and machine learning to train the dinosaur character in the T-Rex Run game. The neural network learns to make decisions based on the game environment, enabling the dinosaur to navigate obstacles and achieve higher scores.

## Features

- Neural network and machine learning for autonomous gameplay.
- Automatic playing of the T-Rex Run game.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/omer-games/Dino-Python-AI.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Program:**

    ```bash
    python dino_game_ai.py
    ```

4. Watch as the dinosaur learns to play the T-Rex Run game autonomously.

## Configuration

You can adjust the machine learning parameters in the `config.txt` file to experiment with different settings.
